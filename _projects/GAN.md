    <p>
        <strong>Infinite Expressions</strong> is a GAN-driven framework designed to animate static facial images by transferring dynamic expressions and head movements from high-quality video datasets. Leveraging the First Order Motion Model, the system integrates multiple deep learning componentsâ€”keypoint detector, dense motion network, and occlusion aware generator to produce photorealistic animated outputs. This self supervised approach eliminates the need for heavily annotated datasets and generalizes across diverse objects.
    </p>

    <h4>Approach:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Keypoint detector maps facial features across frames.</li>
        <li>Dense motion network predicts dense motion fields to align source and driving poses.</li>
        <li>Occlusion-aware generator warps source images and inpaints occluded regions for realistic animation.</li>
        <li>Trained on the <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/">VoxCeleb</a> dataset using a self-supervised learning strategy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Results:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Produces lifelike facial animations from static images.</li>
        <li>Perceptually realistic outputs validated through visual inspection and loss metrics (perceptual, equivariance, discriminator, and generator losses).</li>
        <li>Demonstrates robustness across unseen subjects and significant pose changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Impact:</h4>
    <p>
        This framework has potential applications in entertainment, education, and historical preservation, enabling animated storytelling, immersive learning, and dynamic reconstructions of historical figures.
