    <p>
        AI Research Agent is an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to automate research and knowledge discovery workflows. The pipeline uses multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google GenAI) via LangChain and RESTful APIs, enabling dynamic reasoning, structured data extraction, and multi-source knowledge integration. With custom prompt templates and Pydantic-based parsers, the agent ensures reliable and structured outputs suitable for downstream applications.
    </p>

    <h4>Approach:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Implemented a modular RAG pipeline using LangChain for orchestration and multi-model interaction.</li>
        <li>Developed custom prompt templates tailored for structured reasoning and fact extraction.</li>
        <li>Integrated Pydantic parsers for reliable output validation and schema enforcement.</li>
        <li>Connected external knowledge sources via web search, Wikipedia API, and a custom-built research report generation tool.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Results:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Automated multi-step research report generation with minimal human intervention.</li>
        <li>Improved factual consistency and structure using schema-constrained outputs.</li>
        <li>Demonstrated adaptability across diverse research queries and domains.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Impact:</h4>
    <p>
        The AI Research Agent streamlines knowledge discovery and synthesis, offering applications in academic research, business intelligence, and AI-assisted learning. By combining RAG with multi-model orchestration, it reduces manual effort in information gathering and enables faster, more reliable insights.
