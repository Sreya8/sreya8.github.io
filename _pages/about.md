<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I'm an aspiring [machine learning engineer]() who loves building AI systems that work in the real world. My journey has taken me from Bangalore to [South Korea]() to [Los Angeles](), working on everything from analyzing brain MRIs to building RAG pipelines and fine-tuning language models.

I recently completed my Master's in Computer Science at [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu), where I focused on [machine learning](), [NLP](), and [computer vision](). During undergrad at Christ University, I spent two years as an [exchange student]() at Kyungpook National University in South Korea, earning a [double degree]() and graduating 3rd in my class. Those months in Korean research labs working on computer vision and clinical AI projects showed me how exciting (and challenging) it is to make AI work with real-world data.

I'm drawn to problems where AI can genuinely help people, whether that's assisting doctors with diagnostics or making language models more reliable. I love the entire ML pipeline, from data wrangling to model deployment, and I'm always exploring new papers and techniques.

When I'm not training models, you'll find me on a hiking trail, strategizing over board games, or diving into online courses and ML textbooks to keep learning.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore my work and reach out if you want to chat about AI or research.
